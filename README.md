# ZeusDL

- Yes this is another attempt at making a pytorch wrapper. Hopefully this will be the last 

## Whats new
- A lot of loss functions
- Callbacks for optimizer
- Gradient Clipping
- Seed everything
- Check if certain layer
- Tabulate/count parameters
- Plot loss every n epochs

## Some thank yous
- I would like to be clear here. This is a fork of [Tez](https://github.com/abhishekkrthakur/tez). But they will accept no PRs and.. I plan to add a lot of things which may or may not be accepted. I am very grateful to Abhishek for being such a huge inspiration.
- Many changes that I will add will be based on fastai (Another huge thank you to Jeremy Howard, Sebastian Gugger and Rachel Thomas) and pytorch lightning (More thanks to William Falcon)

## Based on
Firstly a huge thank you to all of these repositories
- [Tez](https://github.com/abhishekkrthakur/tez)
- [fastai](https://github.com/fastai)
- [pytorch lightning](https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning)
And also my own previous efforts
- [sprintdl](https://github.com/SubhadityaMukherjee/sprintdl)
- [lightningAddons](https://github.com/SubhadityaMukherjee/lightningAddOns)
- [tinyDL](https://github.com/SubhadityaMukherjee/tinyDL)
Yes I have been trying this for a solid while :)
